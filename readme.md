3D Image Flip Display
This is a simple example demonstrating how to create a 3D image flip display effect using HTML canvas and JavaScript. The entire functionality is contained within a single index.js file.

Description
This project showcases a basic implementation of a 3D image flip display effect. It utilizes the HTML <canvas> element along with JavaScript to achieve the desired animation.

Usage
Ensure you have an HTML file with a <canvas> element. Give this element an id, for example: id="canvas".
Link the index.js file to your HTML file.
When the page loads, the JavaScript code will automatically execute and create the 3D image flip effect.
Example
You can replace the imageUrl variable in the index.js file with the URL of your desired image. The provided code will load the image onto the canvas and apply the 3D flip animation.
